    \section{Introduction}
      \begin{rightenv}
      
        \subsectionright{}{}{I was very excited to see the job opening as an Index Portfolio Manager, it has been an almost lifelong dream for me to work at an exchange. Today I have a broader interest in the financial sector, but in my mind working at the exchange is still the prime jewel of employment in the financial sector. With more than a decade of experience from the trading floor in Nordea Markets I feel confident that I can add value to Nasdaq.}
        
      \end{rightenv}
      
    \section{Expanding skillset}
      \begin{rightenv}
      
        \subsectionright{}{}{I am betting heavy that the future of the financial sector lies within IT. I am personally aiming to increase my  skills within programming and mathematics. The next job should support those efforts, so it is an important feature that my future job has an aspect of those elements even though they are not dominant. \\ The tools and skills one can obtain within IT today is almost inexhaustible, but fortunately so are the opportunities to learn new skills. In order to properly expand on a skill though, it is important that it is also an integral  part of one´s job, or that it is possible to add the skill as an extra feature in one´s daily work. \\
My own personal desire and drive to develop is also my employers development, because employees run the business, and if employees develop then so does the business. With more than a decade in the financial sector I have seen firsthand what happens to a business area when it is populated by employees with no drive or desire to develop, slowly but steadily it dies.}
        
      \end{rightenv}
      
      \section{Perfect Match}
      \begin{rightenv}
      
        \subsectionright{}{}{As the systematic internalisers and the diversity in marketplaces have challenged the traditional exchanges, a venue as Nasdaq needs employees with an ability to serve with operational perfection. While at the same time being mindfull of the changing times, acting to improve and develop themselves and the business area in which they work, I can contribute with such a mindset. \\ Even though we don´t maintain indexes in Markets we do still adjust our positions as corporate actions happen and my broad knowledge about the financial sector will serve as a solid foundation for succeeding in this position.}
        
      \end{rightenv}
      
      \section{Get In Touch}
      \begin{rightenv}
      
        \subsectionright{}{}{Thank you very much for taking time to consider my application, I have added two references in the margin that you can contact, but please consult me before contacting either of them. \\ I have also added my resume on which you can see more about my educational level, previous work experience and examples of current tasks. All my contact information is included in the resume header so please contact me if you would like to see me for an interview. \\ \\ Best Regards \\ Jonas Hvid}
